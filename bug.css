The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly.  For example, trying to subtract a percentage from a pixel value without proper parentheses will lead to unexpected results.  Another common mistake is using units inconsistently within the `calc()` function, mixing percentages and pixels without proper conversion or understanding of precedence.
