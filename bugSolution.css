The `calc()` function requires careful attention to operator precedence and unit consistency.  Ensure that you use parentheses correctly to group operations.  For example, to subtract a percentage from a pixel value, you must enclose the subtraction within parentheses. Additionally, maintain unit consistency across the entire calculation. Avoid mixing percentages and pixels without explicit conversion to ensure accurate results.  The corrected code will illustrate these principles.
